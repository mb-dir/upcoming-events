# upcoming-events


## Motivation

I sometimes forget about very important events for me for example about visit in the dentist or upcoming exam,
so I have decided that I will create an application which helps me remember these events. And these are fruit of my work ;)

## Usage

There is nothing special, just [click here](https://mb-dir.github.io/upcoming-events/) and bookmark this page - that's all

## Versions

1. **v.1.0.0**(https://github.com/mb-dir/upcoming-events/releases/tag/v.1.0.0)

...In this version the application saves our events in the localstorage, and (based on the localstorage) show these events.
