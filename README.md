# upcoming-events


## Motivation

I sometimes forget about very important events for me for example about visit in the dentist or upcoming exam,
so I have decided that I will create an application which helps me remember these events. And these are fruit of my work ;)

## Usage

There is nothing special, just [click here](https://mb-dir.github.io/upcoming-events/) and bookmark this page - that's all, or the second way to use this application is that you can download/clone this repo and open this project on your own computer(but you have to remember about use liveserver for example from [VSC](https://code.visualstudio.com/), cuz I use [JS Modules](https://javascript.info/modules-intro#what-is-a-module)).

## Versions

- [v.1.0.0](https://github.com/mb-dir/upcoming-events/releases/tag/v.1.0.0).
In this version the application saves our events in the localstorage, and (based on the localstorage) show these events.
- [v.1.1.0](https://github.com/mb-dir/upcoming-events/releases/tag/v.1.1.0).
The application in this version checks if date is not from the past, when date is from the past the application will show information about that to the user.
- [v.1.2.0](https://github.com/mb-dir/upcoming-events/releases/tag/v.1.2.0).
In this version the application sorts events by date.

## My comments

- In my opinion the structure of the files is too complicated, before I started work at this project I have been thinking that splitting structure would be fine, but it is too splitted and very unreadable.

- The graphical interface is simple, but(for me) also very clearly and intuitive, so I am happy with it.

- Unfortunately I cannot say the same about git history, it could be clearer(especially commit messages). Pushing commits like "update readme.md" directly to master branch was not the best idea. The idea with the versions of the project is interesting, and in my opinion good, but version relases should be better descripted.
